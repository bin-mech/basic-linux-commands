# basic linux commands 
## [What is the terminal?](https://itconnect.uw.edu/learn/workshops/online-tutorials/web-publishing/what-is-a-terminal/)
> **Terminals**, also known as command lines or consoles, allow us to accomplish and automate tasks on a computer without the > use of a graphical user interface. Using a terminal allows us to send simple text commands to our computer to do things like > navigate through a directory or copy a file, and form the basis for many more complex automations and programming skills. 

## 1. open a new terminal 
(1). *Open* the Dash by clicking the Ubuntu icon in the upper-left, type `terminal`, and select the Terminal application from the results that appear.

(2). Hit the keyboard *shortcut*: **Ctrl** + **Alt** + **T**

## 2. man & --help command
To know more about a command and how to use it, use the man command. It shows the manual pages of the command.
For example, `man man` shows the manual pages of the **man** command. Typing in the command name and 
the argument help it show which ways the command can be used (e.g., `man --help`)
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ man man  
binli@ubuntu:~$ man --help
```
## 3. pwd command
This command prints the location of your current working directory. It's important to know actually where you're before going to a parent or sub directories.
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ pwd
/home/binli
binli@ubuntu:~$ 
```
"~" - represent the home folder of the user, conventionally it would be /home/user/, where "user" is the user name can be anything like /home/binli.

"$" - is just a sign of the shell prompt, means that shell is ready to accept commands, you can understand it as a separator after which, you can interact with a shell. Can also be "#" which shows that **root** is the user who's session is going on.
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ sudo su -
[sudo] password for binli: 
root@ubuntu:~# 
```
## 4. ls command
**ls** is one of the  most used basic linux commands, used to **print** contents of a directory, by default it lists contents of current working directory(**pwd**).
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ ls
Desktop   Documents   Downloads
Pictures  Public      Videos
binli@ubuntu:~$ 
```
Example, use `ls /usr/bin` to list contents of the **/usr/bin** folder.
## 5. cd command
Assume you are in `/home/binli` directory, you want to go to the `/usr/local/share/fonts` directory, use `cd /usr/local/share/fonts`.
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ pwd
/home/binli
binli@ubuntu:~$ cd /usr/local/share/fonts
binli@ubuntu:~$ pwd
/usr/local/share/fonts
```
## 6. touch command
You can create a blank file with touch command. As example, use `touch hello_world.py` to create a blank `hello_world.py` file under the your home directory.
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ touch hello_world.py
binli@ubuntu:~$ ls
Desktop    Documents    Downloads  hello_world.py
Pictures   Public       Videos
```
## 7. mkdir command
The **mkdir** command creates new directories in your file system. 
Create a new directory called myfiles in the current directory.
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ mkdir myfiles
```
Creates the directory `/home/binli/linux/command/myfiles`. If any of the parent directories `/home/binli/linux` or `/home/binli/linux/command`, do not already exist, they will automatically be created.
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ mkdir -p /home/binli/linux/command/myfiles
```
## 8. chmod
The **chmod** command changes the permissions of files or directories. Only the file owner or a privileged user can change the access mode.
In general, chmod commands take the form:
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ chmod 755 hello_world.py
```
Here the digits 7, 5, and 4 each individually represent the permissions for the **user**, **group**, and **others**, in that order. Each digit is a combination of the numbers 4, 2, 1, and 0:   
**4** stands for **"read"**,  
**2** stands for **"write"**,  
**1** stands for **"execute"**, and  
**0** stands for **"no permission"**.  

## 9. cp command
You can copy files and directories with this command. Typical usage is like 
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ cp hello_world.py hello_world_copy.py
```
To copy a directory, including all its files and subdirectories, to another directory.
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ cp -r Documents Documents-copy
```
Also don't forget to use proper path when you are coping something to different location.

## 10. mv command
The **mv** command is used to move or rename directories and files.
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ mv hello_world.py rename_hello_world.py
binli@ubuntu:~$ mv Documents-copy rename_Documents
```
## 11. rm command
The **rm** command is used to remove directory or files.
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ rm rename_hello_world.py
binli@ubuntu:~$ rm -r rename_Documents
```
## 12. vi command
To edit a file named helle_world.py, use the command:
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ vi rename_hello_world.py
```
to insert text, first move the cursor to the position where you want to insert (text is inserted before the cursor),
then **press** `i` . After that save your changes by **press** the **Esc** key then type `:wq`. If you do not want to save 
the changes type `:q!` instead. For more information search on Google.

## 13. sudo command
**sudo** stands for **"SuperUser Do"**. So, if you want any command to be done with administrative 
or root privileges, you can use the sudo command. For example, if you want to edit a file like viz. 
**/etc/init/network-manager.conf**, which needs root permissions, you can use the command 
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ sudo vi /etc/init/network-manager.conf
```
## 14. apt-get command 
Use apt-get to install packages. This requires root privileges, so use the sudo command with it.
For example, if you want to install the text editor vim, we can type in the command 
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install vim”
```
Similarly, any exist packages can be installed like this. It is good to **update your repository** each time you try to **install a new package**. 
You can do that by typing 
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get update
binli@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get upgrade
binli@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get remove
```
or typing
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get update
binli@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```
The command `apt-cache search` is used to search for a package. If you want to search for one, you can type in `apt-cache search vim` (this doesn't require root).
## 15. more command
Displays text, one screen at a time.
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ more /etc/init/network-manager.conf
```
## 16. hostname command
Use hostname to know your name in your host or network. Basically, it displays your hostname and IP address. 
```
binli@ubuntu:~$ hostname
ubuntu
binli@ubuntu:~$ hostname -I
128.xx.xx.xxx
```
